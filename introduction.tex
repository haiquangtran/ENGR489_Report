\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:intro}

With the numerous food options around us, it is often difficult to decide what to eat. On some days we may feel like eating our favourite foods, but on other days we could feel more explorative, wanting to try something new. There are many factors that determine our decisions on what we want to eat such as our preferences, our current mood, and what food providers are nearby. Other factors that may contribute is the price of the food dish, the cuisine type, the meat type, and so forth. Additionally, a subset of users have food intolerances which restrict their food options, further making the food decision process difficult.

Whatâ€™s On The Menu (WOTM) is a web-centric mobile application that is focused on recommending food dishes to users based on their personal food preferences such as meat preference, cuisine preference, food type etc. These recommendations are based on the previous rating patterns of users and are important as it saves time for users and allows users to explore preferred food options they otherwise might not have discovered alone. Taste is subjective, therefore, WOTM aims at providing personalised recommendations to users in order to achieve the overall goal of ``Find Good Items".

Existing applications such as Yelp \cite{yelp} and Foursquare \cite{foursquare} have similar concepts but lack personalised recommendations for food dishes. These applications focus on a broader scope such as popular restaurants, coffee places, activities, and so forth. This can often lead to a cluttered interface, affecting the user experience, and may provoke confusion in users. Food spotting is an application that focuses on food dishes but does not provide personalised recommendations to users. Instead, they show popular food dishes and focus on crowd-sourcing, relying on users to upload food dishes. What's On The Menu (WOTM) differs as the goal is to recommend personalised food recommendations to the low level granularity of a food dish. This project focuses on the recommendation engine and being able to provide a base recommender system providing personalised recommendations for the application WOTM.

\section{What's On The Menu Overview} \label{section:wotm}

What's On The Menu (WOTM) is a system that aims at providing personalised food recommendations to users. It is currently in development and was created by John Clegg from Summer Of Tech. WOTM consists of two components: WOTM Web and WOTM API. WOTM Web is the front-end of the application that deals with interactions in the client browser. WOTM API is the back-end of the application that deals with the application logic and management of data. I will be extending the existing system by integrating a recommendation system into the WOTM API. This component will connect to the other components to provide recommendations to the users, and will manage anything related to the recommendation system.

\section{Requirements}

The core requirements of this project consist of integrating a recommendation system into WOTM. This recommendation system should be able to provide personalised recommendations to users based on the use case of ``Find Good Items". Specifically, ``Find Good Items" are seen as items that a specific user will prefer based on their personal tastes towards food. Therefore, to fulfill this aim the recommendation system must be able to provide personalised recommendations that will perform more accurately than non-personalised recommendations. 

Another requirement is to examine existing recommendation techniques to find a suitable algorithm for WOTM. Prediction accuracy of various algorithms depend on available user information, the number of users, the number of items and many other factors. Different algorithms perform better in different contexts, thus, an algorithm must be chosen based on the suitability of an application \cite{memorybased}.

\section{Contributions}
In this project, the following contributions have been made. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{A user study has been conducted collecting a dataset containing 91 users, 100 food items, 4207 positive ratings, and 1638 negative ratings.}
	\item{A Single SVD CF System, Dual SVD CF System, Item CF System, and a Hybrid CF System have been implemented based on utilizing Binary Ratings (Likes/Dislikes).}
	\item{An offline evaluation has been conducted for each of the systems above}
	\item{Integration of recommender system has been implemented in WOTM}
	\item{Demonstration that a Hybrid CF approach was able to provide personalised recommendations at an accuracy of 87.06\%, outperforming the popularity baseline which provided non-personalised recommendations at an accuracy of 73.84\%}
\end{enumerate}
