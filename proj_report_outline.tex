\todo{Rewrite the abstract}
The goal of this report is to create an initial recommendation engine in terms of the use case ``Find Good Items". 

\todo{The project compares the ALS method with multiple variations to see which one is suitable in a commercial environment}

The project looks at how a recommender system can be used to recommend food dishes to users based on their personal preferences, their previous actions such as likes/dislikes, and other factors such as their location and price. In particular, this project explores collaborative filtering (CF) techniques by leveraging existing research and explores these algorithms to best suit our application domain of recommending food to users. 

The literature review investigates existing recommender systems that use CF techniques and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each technique to identify suitable CF techniques for our application domain. 

Suitability of these algorithms will be considered on factors that are important for a web-centric mobile application called ``What's On The Menu" currently being developed. The recommender system will have to account for a range of factors from the user experience, the accuracy of the recommendation system, and the speed/performance that the system can provide recommendations to users.

 \item \todo{Problem}
 \item \todo{Current Solutions}
 \item \todo{Problems with Solutions}
 \item \todo{My Great Idea}
\end{enumerate}

% The system will be tested using evaluation techniques (yet to be identified) on real user data. The user data will be collected during the course of Trimester 2, and will test the accuracy in addition to the performance and scalability of the system. This is yet to be determined.
