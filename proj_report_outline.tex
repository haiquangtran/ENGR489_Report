\begin{abstract}

This project explores recommendation techniques to integrate a recommender system into the web-centric mobile application What's On The Menu (WOTM). This recommendation system should be able to provide personalised recommendations to users based on the use case of ``Find Good Items" seen as items that a user will prefer based on their personal tastes towards food.

A user study has been conducted collecting a dataset containing 91 users, 100 food items, 4207 positive ratings, and 1638 negative ratings for an offline evaluation for recommender systems. A baseline predictor system recommending non-personalised items based on popularity was compared to four recommender systems, providing personalised recommendations. These systems were an Item-based SVD approach, a Single SVD approach, a Dual SVD approach, and a Hybrid CF approach. 

Overall, the Hybrid CF system was able to outperform every other system in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Area Under the Curve (ROC). In particular, the Hybrid CF approach was able to provide personalised recommendations at an accuracy of 87.06\%, outperforming the popularity baseline which provided non-personalised recommendations at an accuracy of 73.84\%, fulfilling the goal of ``Find Good Items".  

% The system will be tested using evaluation techniques (yet to be identified) on real user data. The user data will be collected during the course of Trimester 2, and will test the accuracy in addition to the performance and scalability of the system. This is yet to be determined. 
% The project looks at how a recommender system can be used to recommend food dishes to users based on personal food preferences, and previous binary rating patterns (Like/Dislike).
