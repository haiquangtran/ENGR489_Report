\section{Future Work}

\subsection{User Evaluation or Online Evaluation}
In this experiment, we have identified the optimal parameters for each algorithm in order to do an online or user evaluation study. The next step is to conduct a online or user evaluation to see how users respond to the recommendations of each algorithm. From this, we are able to truly see how each algorithm performs in a real scenario, as well as test the novelty and serendipity factor and so forth.
